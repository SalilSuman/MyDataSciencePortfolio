# MyDataSciencePortfolio
This repository is a compilation of the data science projects I have successfully completed. These projects have been made for academic and learning purposes.
The languages that I have used for the same are R and Python.
#### This is the link to my [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/Salil_Suman_Meher) profile.
#### This is the [Notebook](https://github.com/SalilSuman/Python_Projects) compiling all my projects done in Python.
## Contents
###   -Data Visualization
###### 1.[District Wise People's Data](https://rpubs.com/Salil_Suman_Meher/639968) :Tabular and visual analysis of district wise people's data to draw out some meaningful insights which can help us understand and interpret the data so that further actions can be taken accordingly if needed.  
###   -Machine Learning
###### 1.[Content Based Movie Recommendation System](https://rpubs.com/Salil_Suman_Meher/641843) :Building a recommendation system using hierarchical clustering based on the genres of the movies that the viewer has either already watched or rated it high.
###### 2.[Multiple Linear Regression Model](https://rpubs.com/Salil_Suman_Meher/655560) :Establishing an interpretable and deployable Multiple Linear Regression model and checking the assumptions of CLRM, which predicts the results of Baseball and Basketball tournaments using the various independent variables available.
###   -Data Cleaning 
###### 1.[Cleaning and Filtering of Consumer Data](https://rpubs.com/Salil_Suman_Meher/652534) :Efficient cleaning of a consumer data set and drawing out meaningful insights from the processed data which can be of financial help to the organization or help them understand customer behaviour.
